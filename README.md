- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @raissalohanna. I'm currently a Data Scientist and also a PhD candidate in computational chemistry.

- My current interests are on nearest neighbors algorithms and time series analysis for climate and spatial data problems. Also, I develop my research about prediction of optoelectronic properties of dye molecules.

- I have experience data analysis techniques, and machine learning for simple/multiclass classification and Natural Language Processing problems.
